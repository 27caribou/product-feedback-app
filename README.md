# Product Feedback App

This is a full-stack application (built using React.js and JSON Server) that enables users to post any feedback they have about a certain product, sort and filter other requests by category, and interact with other users on the site by commenting on requests posted on the site.

You can check out my work "here".

It is a solution to the [Product feedback app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6).


## Overview

![Design preview for the Product feedback app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser


## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) - REST API
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS Styling, CSS Flexbox and Grid


## Available Scripts

In case you want to try running it locally:

### `npm install`

Installs the project dependencies.

### `npm run server`

This will launch the JSON server.
It should show in the command prompt, but you can open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) followed by the routing parameter to view the data. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) - Another good tutorial series, though I focused more on the API side of it. I liked the way he introduced the use of json-server and how well he implemented it. I really recommend using json-server if you need a quick back-end for your project.
